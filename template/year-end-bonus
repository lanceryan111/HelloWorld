I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for the year-end bonus. I am truly appreciative of the recognition and support from the company.

The bonus is not only a generous acknowledgment of the hard work throughout the year but also a motivating factor as we head into the new year. It means a lot to me and serves as a great encouragement.

I look forward to continuing to contribute to the team's success in the coming year.

Thank you once again, and I wish you and the team a wonderful holiday season.
