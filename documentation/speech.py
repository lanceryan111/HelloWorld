Got it! Here’s a revised version of your speech, emphasizing the reliability and performance reasons for the migration:

Good evening everyone,

I’ll be sharing an update on the GitHub Migration initiative.

The decision to migrate to GitHub was driven by the need for a more reliable and high-performing platform. Bitbucket, while useful in the past, has shown performance issues and reliability concerns that impacted our workflows. This migration ensures that we move to a platform that offers better stability, speed, and developer-friendly features.

Key activities during the migration process included:
	•	Identifying and migrating ios banking repo with all history,
	•	Setting up permissions and ensuring team members had appropriate access,
	•	Validating integrations with our existing tools and CI pipelines

We faced challenges, as expected in any migration of this scale, the ios banking repo has some history. such as ensuring data continuity and testing CI GHA workflows. with careful planning, clear communication and collabrated teamwork., we successfully addressed these issues.
Kudos to Angel, Haifeng, as well as platform folks, a big thank you to Alex for having us back and providing the support to drive the migration forward.										    

Now that we’re on GitHub, we’re already seeing improvements in performance, reliability, and collaboration. GitHub provides enhanced tools for version control, code reviews, and automation, which help streamline our processes and support our teams to work more efficiently.

Lastly, I’d like to thank everyone involved in making this migration a success. Your hard work and dedication have positioned us well for a smoother and more productive development experience.

Happy Holidays and enjoy tonight
