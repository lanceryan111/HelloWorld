Got it! Here’s a revised version of your speech, emphasizing the reliability and performance reasons for the migration:

Good morning everyone,

I’ll be sharing an update on the GitHub Migration initiative.

The decision to migrate to GitHub was driven by the need for a more reliable and high-performing platform. Bitbucket, while useful in the past, has shown performance issues and reliability concerns that impacted our workflows. This migration ensures that we move to a platform that offers better stability, speed, and developer-friendly features.

Key activities during the migration process included:
	•	Identifying and migrating all relevant repositories,
	•	Setting up permissions and ensuring team members had appropriate access,
	•	Validating integrations with our existing tools, and
	•	Minimizing downtime to avoid disruptions to ongoing development.

We faced challenges, as expected in any migration of this scale, such as ensuring data continuity and testing workflows post-migration. However, with careful planning, extensive testing, and clear communication, we successfully addressed these issues.

Now that we’re on GitHub, we’re already seeing improvements in performance, reliability, and collaboration. GitHub provides enhanced tools for version control, code reviews, and automation, which help streamline our processes and support our teams to work more efficiently.

Lastly, I’d like to thank everyone involved in making this migration a success. Your hard work and dedication have positioned us well for a smoother and more productive development experience.

Thank you! I’m happy to take any questions or provide additional details after this session.

This version highlights the key reasons for moving to GitHub while maintaining a professional tone. Let me know if you’d like any more tweaks!
