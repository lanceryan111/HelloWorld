Here is a draft for your 2–3 minute speech about GitHub migration based on the details provided:

Good morning everyone,

I’ll be sharing an update on the GitHub Migration initiative.

As part of our broader efforts to streamline development workflows and improve collaboration, we migrated our repositories to GitHub. The primary goal of this migration was to provide a more modern, efficient, and developer-friendly platform. GitHub offers better version control, integration capabilities, and tools that enhance code management and team productivity.

Key activities during the migration process included:
	•	Identifying the existing repositories that needed to be migrated,
	•	Ensuring all team members had appropriate access and permissions,
	•	Testing integrations to guarantee a seamless transition, and
	•	Collaborating with stakeholders to minimize disruptions to development cycles.

One of the key challenges we encountered was ensuring data integrity and continuity, especially during active development. To address this, we conducted thorough testing, communicated regularly across teams, and established contingency plans to address any unexpected issues.

With the migration now complete, we’ve already observed improvements in collaboration, code review processes, and automation through GitHub Actions. It also enables us to integrate better with other tools we use, which ultimately accelerates our development timelines.

Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the hard work of the teams and individuals who contributed to this migration. Your efforts ensured a smooth transition and have set us up for future success.

Thank you! I’m happy to answer any questions or discuss further after the session.

Let me know if you’d like any refinements or additions!
