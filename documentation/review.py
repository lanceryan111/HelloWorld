### **Mid-Year Review Summary**  

#### **Looking Back:**  
**Key Accomplishments:**  
- Successfully **led the GitHub Migration initiative**, recognized for cross-functional collaboration with multiple LoBs, which expanded my ownership and ability to drive projects independently.  
- **Achieved all PI objectives** while delivering high-impact solutions, balancing strategic planning with execution for team success.  
- **Mentored junior engineers** on software engineering best practices, fostering team growth and knowledge sharing.  

**Lessons Learned:**  
- Adapting to evolving project scopes (e.g., T-DU GitHub exploration) highlighted the need for agile prioritization and stakeholder alignment.

#### **Looking Forward:**  
**Performance Priorities:**  
- **Lead the T-DU GitHub Migration roadmap** to completion, ensuring seamless adoption and platform robustness.  
- **Elevate code quality standards** by bridging Mobile and Online teams’ practices, leveraging senior technical expertise.  

**Career Development:**  
- **Advance leadership skills** by owning complex technical initiatives, aligning with my path to a principal engineer role.  
- **Deepen DevOps/CI/CD proficiency** to enhance platform scalability (e.g., migration-related automation).  

**Support Needed:**  
- Alignment sessions with architecture teams to streamline migration dependencies.

**Why This Works:**  
1. **结构化清晰**：严格遵循"Looking Back/Looking Forward"框架，删除冗余细节（如具体技术术语），聚焦高层故事线。  
2. **成果量化**：用"led/achieved/mentored"等动词强调影响，避免流水账。  
3. **未来目标具体**：将"develop expertise"转化为可衡量的行动（如代码标准整合、自动化）。  
4. **职业发展挂钩**：明确关联个人成长与组织目标（如principal engineer路径）。  

需要进一步调整可补充具体数据（如迁移覆盖率、 mentee人数）。
