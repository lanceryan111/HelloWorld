Here’s an enhanced roadmap that includes change management, a code freeze period, handling of dependency repositories, and strategies for continuous migration. These additions will help minimize disruptions and keep all teams aligned.

1. Planning & Preparation

	•	Assess Repositories and Dependencies:
	•	List all repositories for migration, including dependency repositories (e.g., shared libraries, submodules, third-party integrations).
	•	Document repository interdependencies and determine the migration order.
	•	Define Change Management Process:
	•	Assign a migration lead or migration team responsible for overseeing the entire migration.
	•	Set up a dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack, email group) for migration updates.
	•	Establish a Code Freeze Period:
	•	Decide on a code freeze period (typically 24–48 hours) to prevent new changes during the final migration.
	•	Communicate the freeze period to stakeholders, developers, and release teams well in advance.
	•	Create Corresponding Repositories in GitHub:
	•	Set up repositories on GitHub, including dependency repositories, to mirror the structure on Bitbucket.
	•	Plan for Continuous Migration:
	•	For teams requiring minimal downtime, define a method to handle incremental migrations (e.g., syncing new commits during the migration period).

2. Repository Migration

	•	Initiate Code Freeze:
	•	Begin code freeze at the scheduled time. Make all repositories read-only on Bitbucket.
	•	Mirror Repository Migration:
	•	Clone and Push Main Repositories:

git clone --mirror https://bitbucket.org/<username>/<main-repo>.git
cd <main-repo>.git
git remote add github https://github.com/<username>/<main-repo>.git
git push --mirror github


	•	Clone and Push Dependency Repositories:
	•	Follow the same steps above for each dependency repository.

	•	Verification:
	•	Validate that all branches, tags, and commit history have transferred correctly to GitHub.
	•	Continuous Sync (if needed):
	•	If the freeze period is insufficient, consider using a tool like git fast-export and git fast-import to capture and replay recent commits from Bitbucket to GitHub.

3. Metadata Migration (Issues, PRs, and Wikis)

	•	Migrate Issues and Pull Requests:
	•	Export issues and PRs from Bitbucket using the Bitbucket API.
	•	Import issues into GitHub using the GitHub Issues Importer or the GitHub API.
	•	Migrate Wiki Content:
	•	Migrate each wiki repository by cloning from Bitbucket and pushing to GitHub as described in the previous roadmap.
	•	Dependencies Tracking:
	•	Document issues or PRs that may need to reference dependency repositories.
	•	Ensure any references to dependency repositories in issues and PRs are updated to reflect the new GitHub links.

4. Reconfigure CI/CD Pipelines, Webhooks, and Dependency Integrations

	•	CI/CD Migration:
	•	Migrate Bitbucket Pipelines to GitHub Actions or adapt them to your preferred CI/CD tool.
	•	For dependency repositories, ensure that workflows referencing shared libraries or submodules are updated to the new GitHub URLs.
	•	Webhooks and Integrations:
	•	Reconfigure any webhooks (e.g., for external tools like Slack or Jira) to point to GitHub.
	•	If you have dependency repositories with integration needs, update those webhooks as well.
	•	Set Up Dependency Management:
	•	If your system uses package managers (e.g., npm, Maven), update any references or scripts that point to Bitbucket URLs.

5. Testing and Validation

	•	Testing of Main and Dependency Repositories:
	•	Test that each repository (including dependencies) is functional on GitHub and that all branches build and run as expected.
	•	Test inter-repository references (e.g., submodules, shared libraries) to ensure they resolve correctly on GitHub.
	•	Verify CI/CD Pipelines and Workflows:
	•	Run tests for all CI/CD workflows and automation to confirm proper configuration.
	•	Test any dependencies or shared libraries referenced in workflows to ensure they compile correctly in GitHub.
	•	Confirm Metadata Integrity:
	•	Validate that issues, PRs, comments, and wikis migrated correctly.

6. Finalization and Cleanup

	•	End Code Freeze:
	•	Once testing and validation are complete, end the code freeze and announce that teams can resume normal development.
	•	Make Bitbucket Repositories Read-Only:
	•	Archive or set Bitbucket repositories to read-only to prevent accidental usage.
	•	Update Documentation and Repository References:
	•	Update all internal and external documentation with the new GitHub repository URLs.
	•	Notify all relevant teams and stakeholders of the successful migration.
	•	Post-Migration Support:
	•	Provide support for any issues or adjustments that arise post-migration.
	•	Set up GitHub-based monitoring and alerts to ensure continued stability.

7. Continuous Migration and Monitoring

	•	Set Up Continuous Sync (if needed):
	•	If there’s a need for ongoing synchronization (e.g., Bitbucket as a backup), set up a scheduled job to sync recent commits from Bitbucket to GitHub.
	•	Monitor Repositories:
	•	Keep an eye on GitHub repositories and workflows for any issues, especially dependency-related configurations.
	•	Backups:
	•	Schedule regular backups for critical repositories and dependencies in GitHub.
	•	Decommission Bitbucket:
	•	Once GitHub is fully stable and all dependencies are confirmed to work, consider decommissioning or archiving Bitbucket as per policy.

This roadmap aims to ensure a smooth, coordinated migration with minimal disruption, accounting for dependencies, continuous sync, and change management considerations. Let me know if you need further customization!
