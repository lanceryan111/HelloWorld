Yes! Here’s a high-level summary of a typical GitHub migration roadmap:
	1.	Planning and Assessment
	•	Evaluate Current Systems: Assess the current source control setup, CI/CD pipelines, and integration points.
	•	Define Goals: Identify migration goals, like improving collaboration, adding CI/CD, or enhancing security.
	•	Scope and Timeline: Determine which repositories to migrate, prioritize them, and set a timeline.
	2.	Preparation
	•	Audit Repositories: Review repositories for dependencies, sensitive data, and other critical aspects.
	•	Set Up GitHub: Ensure your GitHub organization, teams, permissions, and project structures are ready.
	•	Access and Permissions: Prepare access and permission structures, mirroring what exists or defining new standards.
	3.	Migration Testing
	•	Pilot Migration: Select a smaller, non-critical repository for an initial migration.
	•	Check for Issues: Verify the code, history, permissions, and functionality post-migration.
	•	Adjust and Document: Update your process based on feedback, and document any unique requirements.
	4.	Data Migration
	•	Code and History: Migrate the actual code, history, and branches to GitHub.
	•	Adjust Integrations: Reconfigure CI/CD, webhooks, or any third-party integrations for GitHub.
	•	Run Tests: Ensure the migrated repositories work as expected with CI/CD, dependency management, and access control.
	5.	Post-Migration Validation
	•	Repository Checks: Confirm code integrity, history, and permissions match the source.
	•	User Training and Feedback: Train team members on GitHub workflows, PRs, and any new tools.
	•	Monitor and Resolve Issues: Address any issues reported post-migration.
	6.	Project Wrap-Up
	•	Review and Optimize: Look for ways to optimize GitHub usage, such as leveraging actions or enhanced permissions.
	•	Document and Report: Finalize documentation and provide a migration report.
	•	Decommission Legacy Systems: Once fully validated, consider decommissioning previous systems if no longer needed.
