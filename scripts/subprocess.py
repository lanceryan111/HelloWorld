To call a shell command in Python using subprocess, especially for a complex command like the one shown in your image, you can use the `subprocess.run()` function with the `shell=True` parameter. Here's how you can rewrite the `select_xcode` function to use subprocess:



```python
import subprocess
import os

def select_xcode(self):
    IOS_CLIENT_VERSION = os.environ.get('IOS_CLIENT_VERSION', '')  # Get from environment variable
    command = f"""plutil -p \
        build/Dynatrace/{IOS_CLIENT_VERSION}/ios/agent/Dynatrace.framework/Info.plist | \
        grep DTXplatformBuild | \
        sed 's/.*>(.*)<.*/\\1/'"""
    
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        DYNATRACE_XCODE = result.stdout.strip()
        print(f"{{DYNATRACE_XCODE}}")
        return DYNATRACE_XCODE
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error executing command: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    xcode = select_xcode(None)  # Passing None as self since it's not used in the function
    if xcode:
        print(f"Selected Xcode version: {xcode}")
    else:
        print("Failed to select Xcode version")

```

This Python script does the following:

1. It imports the necessary modules: `subprocess` for running shell commands and `os` for accessing environment variables.

2. The `select_xcode` function is defined to replicate the shell command in Python.

3. It uses `os.environ.get()` to retrieve the `IOS_CLIENT_VERSION` from environment variables. You should set this variable before running the script.

4. The shell command is constructed as a multi-line string for better readability.

5. `subprocess.run()` is used with `shell=True` to execute the complex shell command. The `check=True` parameter raises an exception if the command fails, `capture_output=True` captures the output, and `text=True` returns the output as a string.

6. The output is stripped of whitespace and stored in `DYNATRACE_XCODE`.

7. Error handling is implemented using a try-except block to catch and report any `subprocess.CalledProcessError`.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `select_xcode.py`).
2. Set the `IOS_CLIENT_VERSION` environment variable before running the script:
   ```
   export IOS_CLIENT_VERSION=your_version_here
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python select_xcode.py
   ```

This approach allows you to run the complex shell command within Python while maintaining its structure and functionality. It's more robust than using `os.system()` as it provides better error handling and output capture capabilities.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
