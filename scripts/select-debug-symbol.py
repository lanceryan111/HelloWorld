Here's the `fetch_debug_symbols` function converted to Python:

```python
import os
import shutil
import zipfile

def fetch_debug_symbols():
    fetch_artifact("Application Debug Symbols", SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE, DSYM_URL)
    
    # Repacking the symbol file because Dynatrace symbol tool doesn't recognize the preceding dSYMs folder that we recently added
    INCLUDES_PREFIX = f"unzip -l build/{SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE} dSYMs/ | grep dSYMs | wc -l | xargs"
    
    if int(os.popen(INCLUDES_PREFIX).read().strip()) == 1:
        # Unzip the source symbol file
        with zipfile.ZipFile(f"build/{SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE}", 'r') as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall("build")
        
        # Move the contents to /tmp
        shutil.move(f"build/{SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE}", "/tmp")
        
        # Change to the build/dSYMs directory
        os.chdir("build/dSYMs")
        
        # Create a new zip file
        with zipfile.ZipFile(f"../../{SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE}", 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
            for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.'):
                for file in files:
                    zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file))
        
        # Change back to the original directory
        os.chdir("../..")
        
        # Remove the build/dSYMs directory
        shutil.rmtree("build/dSYMs")

# Note: This function assumes the following variables are defined:
# SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE, DSYM_URL
# It also assumes the fetch_artifact function is defined
```

This Python version of the `fetch_debug_symbols` function does the following:

1. Calls `fetch_artifact` to get the debug symbols.
2. Checks if the downloaded file needs repacking.
3. If repacking is needed, it:
   - Extracts the contents of the zip file
   - Moves the original file to /tmp
   - Repacks the contents without the 'dSYMs' prefix
   - Cleans up temporary files

To use this function, you'll need to:
- Import necessary modules (os, shutil, zipfile)
- Define the global variables (SOURCE_SYMBOL_FILE, DSYM_URL)
- Implement the `fetch_artifact` function

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
