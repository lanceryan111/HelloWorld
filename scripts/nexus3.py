To fetch file content from Nexus 3 using Python requests, you'll typically need to authenticate and then download the file. Here's a recommended approach:

1. Use Nexus 3 API authentication:
   Nexus 3 usually uses token-based authentication. You'll need to obtain a token first.

2. Make the request to download the file:
   Use the token in your request header.

Here's a sample code structure:

```python
import requests

# Nexus 3 server details
nexus_url = "https://your-nexus-server/repository"
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

# File details
repository = "your_repository"
file_path = "path/to/your/file"

# Authenticate and get token
auth_url = f"{nexus_url}/service/rest/v1/security/tokens"
auth_response = requests.post(auth_url, json={"username": username, "password": password})
token = auth_response.json().get('token')

if not token:
    raise Exception("Authentication failed")

# Prepare headers with token
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'
}

# Download file
file_url = f"{nexus_url}/{repository}/{file_path}"
response = requests.get(file_url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    # File successfully downloaded
    file_content = response.content
    # Process or save the file content as needed
else:
    print(f"Failed to download file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

Key points:
1. Replace placeholders (nexus_url, username, password, repository, file_path) with your actual values.
2. This uses token-based authentication. Adjust if your Nexus setup uses a different method.
3. Error handling and timeout management should be added for production use.
4. If downloading large files, consider using `stream=True` in the request and processing the file in chunks.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this process or discuss alternative authentication methods?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
