**Strengths and Advantages**

1. As a bank employee who is familiar with all the processes and tools, I understand the development patterns and have experience working with various teams (Dev, QA, AppSec, Operations). I have developed strong relationships with these teams, backed by proven consulting and collaboration skills, in addition to my technical expertise. I can contribute from day one with minimal onboarding time.

2. Coming in as a Senior DevOps Consultant, my advantage is the hands-on experience I've gained working within CIBC’s Enterprise Technology department. I have successfully promoted and implemented DevOps solutions across multiple teams. I am confident I will bring a unique perspective to this new role, as I fully understand the needs of development teams. Our team is the product owner of enterprise toolchains, and I am familiar with the vendors, tools, and methods needed to integrate these tools with mobile DevOps. With my comprehensive knowledge of enterprise tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Artifactory, Ansible, JIRA, and Confluence, I have extensive experience implementing DevOps methodologies and best practices. I’ve led technical solutions in both cloud and on-premises environments to improve application delivery processes across the bank. My experience will enable me to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in mobile DevOps delivery, helping teams achieve greater efficiency and simplicity.

3. I also have experience with mobile DevOps. For example, I have been actively involved in CIBC's mobile banking development and delivery efforts.
