“I’ve really appreciated my current role as a Senior DevOps Engineer — it’s allowed me to deepen my expertise in infrastructure, automation, and system reliability. At the same time, I’m always looking for opportunities where I can apply those skills to areas with a broader impact.

The Financial Crime Prevention team’s mission resonates with me because it’s tackling real-world problems that affect people and institutions every day. I see this as a chance to contribute to something socially meaningful while continuing to grow professionally.

I’m especially interested in the challenge of supporting secure, high-availability systems in such a sensitive domain, and I believe my background in scalable, secure DevOps practices can add value to the team. This move aligns well with my goal of applying technical leadership in areas that combine engineering with real-world impact.”
