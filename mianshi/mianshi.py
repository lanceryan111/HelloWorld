Thank you for the clearer image! Here's a rephrased and more professional version of the text:

**Why I am interested in this position**

I am always eager to grow and explore new opportunities, particularly in cloud transformation and automation. This role would allow me to deepen my understanding of automation strategies and contribute to the cloud adoption process within CIBC. Leveraging my expertise in automation design (AD), I aim to enhance OCP (OpenShift Container Platform) to ensure it is more adaptable and scalable for a broader range of users. Given CIBC's increasing adoption of cloud-based technologies, I am excited to be part of this transformation.

I possess comprehensive expertise in enterprise tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Artifactory, JIRA, and Confluence, with extensive hands-on experience in implementing cloud-based automation methodologies and best practices. I have successfully led and implemented technical solutions across both cloud and on-premises platforms, improving application delivery processes throughout the bank.

I am also well-versed in the OCP platform, having utilized it extensively since joining CIBC. I have collaborated with over ten different teams at CIBC on their cloud transformation journey, assisting them in building applications from the ground up, archiving images, and eventually deploying to OCP. For instance, I recently completed an engagement with INNO, implementing a fully automated pipeline for their front-end and back-end applications. The transition to OCP, rather than on-premises solutions, was met with enthusiasm by the teams, and I am confident that OCP will be fully integrated and adopted by all AD teams. With my deep understanding of this platform, I am well-equipped to address any challenges and support the AD team's objectives.
