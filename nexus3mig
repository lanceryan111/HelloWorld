**Subject:** Clarification on Nexus Migration from repo.ca to rp.ca  

**Hi [Support Team/Recipient's Name],**  

We understand that there is an ongoing plan to migrate Nexus from **repo.ca** to **rp.ca**, but our team has not been included in the communication regarding the timeline or specific actions required. To ensure a smooth transition, we would appreciate clarification on the following:  

1. **Timeline**:  
   - When is the migration scheduled to take place?  
   - Are there critical deadlines we need to be aware of?  

2. **Required Actions**:  
   - Beyond updating to the new URL (**rp.ca**), are there additional steps our team needs to complete?  
     - E.g., configuration changes, dependency updates, or compatibility testing.  
   - Will there be downtime, and do we need to prepare contingency plans?  

3. **Communication Gap**:  
   - Could we be added to future updates or meetings related to this migration?  
   - Is there documentation or a checklist we should review?  

We want to ensure alignment with the migration process and avoid any disruptions. Please let us know if a follow-up discussion or a shared workspace (e.g., Confluence page) would be helpful.  

Thank you for your guidance!  

**Best regards,**
