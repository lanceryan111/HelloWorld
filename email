Subject: Introduction to Dynatrace Upload Automation

Hi Team,

I’d like to share an update regarding the new Dynatrace Upload Automation we’ve implemented.

This automation simplifies and standardizes the process of uploading Android mapping files to Dynatrace. Instead of manually fetching artifacts and performing uploads, the new Python-based tool handles everything automatically — including:
	•	Fetching the correct artifact version from Nexus
	•	Extracting metadata dynamically (e.g., environment, version, build ID)
	•	Determining the correct Dynatrace environment (dev, pat, prod, etc.) based on metadata
	•	Uploading mapping files securely to the corresponding Dynatrace instance

The script is designed to be easily integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps or Jenkins) and only requires minimal configuration.

If your team is interested in adopting or testing this automation, please let me know — I can provide setup guidance and an example Fastfile integration for Android builds.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Team or Department]
